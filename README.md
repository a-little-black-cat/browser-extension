# Browser Extension: A Productivity Booster (PB)
## This browser extension works by having the user enter the desired websites to the extension. Following this, the extension will block access to certain sites.

###Are you a student that finds themselves on social media for a long period of time even after uninstalling it on their personal device because you forgot you had access to it on the browser and muscle memory led you back to the productivity-killing websites? Look no further!
###To block websites, download the zip file, extract all and add extension on Chrome Browser. After that, enable the extension, enter the URLs of the websites that you need press save, and enjoy (try not to get bored) a social media-less browsing experience.
###P.s. Twitter/x is hard to block. Other sites such as Instagram can be blocked by entering instagram.com to the extension. However, twitter/x's redirection is hard to block. (currently trying to find the one URL that works to block it)
